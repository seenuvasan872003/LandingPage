          question: "How do I set up my WhatsApp Business account with GoWhats?",
          answer: "Setting up your WhatsApp Business account is straightforward with our guided onboarding process. First, you'll need to create a GoWhats account and choose your subscription plan. Then, we'll help you register for WhatsApp Business API access, which requires business verification and documentation. Our team will assist you through the entire process, including phone number verification, business profile setup, and message template creation. The typical setup time is 24-48 hours after account verification, though WhatsApp's approval process may take 1-3 business days depending on your documentation."

        {
          question: "What are the system requirements and technical prerequisites?",
          answer: "GoWhats is a cloud-based platform that works on any modern web browser, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Our platform is mobile-responsive, so you can manage your WhatsApp communications from any device, anywhere in the world."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does the complete setup process take?",
          answer: "The complete setup process typically takes 2-5 business days from start to finish. Account creation and initial platform setup can be completed within minutes. The main time factor is WhatsApp Business API approval, which depends on your business documentation and compliance with WhatsApp's policies. During this time, our onboarding team will help you prepare message templates, set up automation rules, and configure your dashboard. Enterprise clients with complex integration requirements may need additional setup time, which we'll discuss during the consultation phase."

          answer: "Our pricing is transparent and based on two components: monthly subscription fees and message usage charges. Subscription fees cover platform access, features, and support, while message fees are charged based on WhatsApp's official rates, which vary by country and message type. We offer three main plans: Starter ($29/month), Business ($99/month), and Enterprise ($299/month), each with different feature sets and message allowances. All plans include core features like message management, basic automation, and analytics. Higher tiers add advanced automation, API access, priority support, and custom integrations."

          question: "What's included in the free trial and how does it work?",
          answer: "Our 14-day free trial includes full access to all core features, 100 free messages, basic automation tools, template creation, and email support. No credit card is required to start the trial, and you can upgrade to a paid plan at any time. During the trial, you'll have access to our onboarding team, documentation, and training resources. The trial includes WhatsApp Business API setup assistance and guidance on best practices. If you don't upgrade before the trial ends, your account will be paused, but your data will be preserved for 30 days in case you decide to continue."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any setup fees, hidden charges, or long-term contracts?",
          answer: "There are no setup fees for our Starter and Business plans, and we believe in transparent pricing with no hidden charges. Enterprise clients may have implementation fees depending on custom requirements and integrations, which are clearly outlined in the proposal. We don't require long-term contracts â€“ all plans are month-to-month with the option to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time. WhatsApp message charges are passed through at cost with no markup. Additional services like premium support, custom integrations, and training sessions are clearly priced and optional."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I change my plan anytime and how does billing work?",
          answer: "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time through your account dashboard. Plan changes take effect immediately, and billing is prorated based on your usage and remaining subscription period. We use secure payment processing through Stripe and PayPal, with automatic monthly billing. You'll receive detailed invoices showing subscription fees, message usage, and any additional services. For annual subscriptions, we offer a 20% discount. Enterprise clients can arrange custom billing terms, including quarterly or annual invoicing."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if I exceed my plan's message limits?",
          answer: "If you exceed your plan's included message allowance, additional messages are charged at $0.05 per message, which is competitive with industry standards. We'll send notifications when you're approaching your limit (at 80% and 95% usage) so you can upgrade your plan or manage your usage accordingly. There are no overage penalties or service interruptions â€“ messages will continue to be delivered and billed at the standard rate. You can set usage alerts and spending limits in your dashboard to maintain budget control."
